## Description 

![Demonstration of prompts in a CLI and the generated webpage output](./assets/images/team-profile-generator-brief.gif)

This command line application prompts the user to enter pertinent details about a team manager and offers the option to add as many additional team members as desired. The prompts are tailored to the team member's role, and the user's answers are validated and sanitized.

When the user elects to stop adding team members, the application dynamically generates an HTML file to display the details for each team member, including active links for each team member's email address and (if applicable) GitHub profile.

In addition, this project incorporates unit testing using Jest. Each class in this application was created with a Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology, in which the tests were written first and the application code was written to satisfy the tests.

## Learning Points 

By completing this project, I learned how to complete JavaScript unit testing with Jest. My experience with Jest was very different from my previous experience using JUnit for Java unit testing.
